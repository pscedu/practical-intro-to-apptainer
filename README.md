# Data Exploration of HuBMAP data on Bridges-2: HuBMAP’s scRNA-seq Data Analysis, Venn diagrams, and Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA)

This repository has the modules presented in the `Data Exploration of HuBMAP data on Bridges-2` workshop held in Puerto Rico.

## About the workshop
The Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is a program funded by the US National Institutes of Health to characterize the human body at single cell resolution, integrated to other efforts such as the Human Cell Atlas.

You are invited to attend a comprehensive, two-day workshop hosted at the Universidad Ana G. Mendez. This workshop is designed for professionals and enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of data exploration and analysis with Python, single-cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis of data from the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), Venn diagrams and Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA).

This workshop is open to members of PR-INBRE Bioinformatics Community of Practice (BiCoP).

Who should attend? Faculty, research staff and students looking to learn more about data exploration on public data from HuBMAP using OpenOnDemand on Bridges-2.

Why should I attend? Data exploration from HuBMAP public data within the context of open science and FAIR principles fosters collaborative research and knowledge discovery. Researchers can freely access and analyze diverse datasets encompassing human tissue samples, promoting transparency and reproducibility in biomedical research. By adhering to FAIR principles, HuBMAP ensures that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, facilitating comprehensive exploration of human biology and disease mechanisms across scientific disciplines. This open approach empowers scientists to uncover novel insights into tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and molecular profiles, advancing our understanding of human health and paving the way for innovative medical interventions.
