This repository has the answers for the exercises presented in the `A Practical Introduction to Apptainer on Bridges-2` held in Puerto Rico.

## About the workshop

You are invited to attend a comprehensive, full-day workshop hosted at the University of Puerto Rico. This workshop is designed for professionals and enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of containerization in HPC systems.

The workshop will provide focused exploration of Apptainer on Bridges-2, offering participants an opportunity to gain practical insights and knowledge in this area.

Apptainer, formerly known as Singularity, streamlines container creation and execution processes. This session will focus on practical applications, including:

- Deployment of legacy and developmental code
- Deployment of useful utilities using Anaconda
- Initiation of services
- Multi-layered builds
- Containerization and adherence to [FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

This workshop is open to members of [PR-INBRE](https://inbre.hpcf.upr.edu/) Bioinformatics Community of Practice (BiCoP).

Date: March 19, 2024
Location: University of Puerto Rico - Medical Science Campus
Building: Center for Informatics and Technology 8th Floor
8:30am to 4:00

Who should attend? Faculty, research staff and students looking to learn more about containerization on Bridges-2.

Why should I attend? Faculty and research staff members stand to gain valuable insights by learning how containers enhance reproducibility within the framework of open science and the FAIR principles. Understanding containerization techniques empowers researchers to increase the credibility and impact of their work, facilitate collaboration, streamline research workflows, ensure research longevity, strengthen funding opportunities, and foster ongoing professional development. These skills not only contribute to individual research endeavors but also promote transparency, rigor, and efficiency within the broader scientific community.
